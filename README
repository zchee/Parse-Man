NAME
    `Parse::Man' - parse nroff-formatted manpages

DESCRIPTION
    This abstract subclass of Parser::MGC recognises nroff grammar from a
    file or string value. It invokes methods when various nroff directives
    are encountered. It is intended that this class be used as a base class,
    with methods provided to handle the various directives and formatting
    options. Typically a subclass will store intermediate results in a data
    structure, building it as directed by these method invocations.

TEXT CHUNK FORMATTING METHOD
    The following method is used to handle formatted text. Each call is
    passed a plain string value from the input content.

  $parser->chunk( $text, %opts )
    The `%opts' hash contains the following options:

    font => STRING
        The name of the current font (`R', `B', etc..)

    size => INT
        The current text size, relative to a paragraph base of 0.

    Other font requests that are found in `\fX' or `\f(AB' requests are
    handled by similarly-named methods.

PARAGRAPH HANDLING METHODS
    The following methods are used to form paragraphs out of formatted text
    chunks. Their return values are ignored.

  $parser->para_TH( $name, $section )
    Handles the `.TH' paragraph which gives the page title and section
    number.

  $parser->para_SH( $title )
    Handles the `.SH' paragraph, which gives a section header.

  $parser->para_SS( $title )
    Handles the `.SS' paragraph, which gives a sub-section header.

  $parser->para_TP( $opts )
    Handles a `.TP' paragraph, which gives a term definition.

  $parser->para_IP( $opts )
    Handles a `.IP' paragraph, which is indented like the definition part of
    a `.TP' paragraph.

  $parser->para_P( $opts )
    Handles the `.P', `.PP' or `.LP' paragraphs, which are all synonyms for
    a plain paragraph content.
