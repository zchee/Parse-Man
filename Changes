         * Nicer method for handling chunks

            + represent font vs. size as two different options
         * Recognise two-character font names like \f(CW
         * Ensure that man-to-html.pl handles \f(CW as <tt>
         * Optionally create an index of manpages
         * Allow 'also' aliasing of manpages
